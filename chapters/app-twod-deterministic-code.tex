\chapter{Two Dimensional Deterministic Code}\label{app:twod-deterministic-code}

Here is the code that was used to produce the plot shown in Figure
\ref{fig:twod-deterministic-error} as seen in Chapter
\ref{chap:twod-deterministic}

import numpy as np
from math import sin, cos, pi
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sns.set_style('whitegrid')

from fem.twod_deterministic import solve_system, L2_error

a, b, c = # Coefficients are set depending on the problem

def u(x,y):
    # Exact solution is set depending on the problem

def f(x, y):
    # The RHS of the equation is set depending on the problem

def do_fem(f, a, b, c):

    NS = [4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512]
    errors = []

    # For each mesh density
    for N in NS:

        # Solve the system
        xs, ys, U = solve_system(f, N, a, b, c)

        # Calculate the error
        errors.append(L2_error(u, U, N))

        # Plot one of the results
        if N == 64:
            fig, ax = plt.subplots(1)
            p = ax.pcolor(xs, ys, U, cmap='viridis')
            ax.set_xlabel(r"$x$", fontsize=18)
            ax.set_ylabel(r"$y$", fontsize=18)
            fig.colorbar(p)
            fig.savefig('twod-deterministic-approx.pdf')

    return (NS, errors), fig
\end{lstlisting}

The above code makes use of two important functions \incode{solve\_system} and
\incode{L2\_error}, the full details of their implementation can be seen in the
following:
