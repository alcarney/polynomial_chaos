\chapter{One Dimensional Deterministic Case}\label{chap:oned-deterministic}

The simplest form of Laplace's Equation we can consider is the one dimensional
case where the coefficients are deterministic in which case the equation is
given by:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:oned-deterministic}
\begin{aligned}
    -au''(x) + bu'(x) + cu(x) &= f(x) &\text{ in } D = [0, 1] \\
                         u(x) &= 0 &\text{ on } \delta D = \{0, 1\}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

We consider the equation in the interval $[0,1]$ and prescribe a zero Dirichlet
condition at the endpoints $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.

\section{Weak Formulation}

In order to obtain the weak formulation of the problem we need to take the
inner product of \myref{eq:oned-deterministic} with a function $v$ from a
\textit{test space} of functions $W$. Then in this weak sense finding a
solution means finding a function $u$ from some \textit{trial space} $V$ which
satisfies the equation $\forall v\in W$

In the case of this problem, the test and trial spaces actually coincide and we
define them as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{array}{c c}
        V = H^1_0(D) & W = H^1_0(D)
    \end{array}
\end{equation}

where $H^1_0(D)$ is a subspace of the one dimensional Sobolev Space $H^1(D)$ as
defined in Definition \ref{def:oned-H1-D} where all elements vanish at the
boundary. It is worth noting that the boundary in this case is a measure zero
set hence it's impossible to define an unique solution in this way! Therefore
we have to define $H^1_0(D)$ slightly differently, consider
$C^\infty_0(\mathbb{R})$ the space of infinitely smooth functions defined on
$\mathbb{R}$ with compact support. This space is dense in $H^1(\mathbb{R})$ so
we can therefore write any function in $\mathbb{R}$ as a limit of some sequence
in $C_0^\infty(\mathbb{R})$. Then, by restricting to the domain $D$ we define
$H^1_0(D)$ as the closure of $C_0^\infty(D)$ (with respect to the Sobolev
norm).

So, multiplying through with some $v \in W$ and integrating over the domain we
obtain:

\begin{equation}
    -a\int_0^1{u''(x)v(x)\ dx} + b\int_0^1{u'(x)v(x)\ dx}
    + c\int_0^1{u(x)v(x)\ dx} = \int_0^1{f(x)v(x)\ dx}
\end{equation}

Integrating the first term by parts gives us:

\begin{equation}
    -a\int_0^1{u''(x)v(x)\ dx} = -a\underbrace{[ u'(x)v(x) ]_0^1}_{ = 0}
    + a\int_0^1{u'(x)v'(x)\ dx}
\end{equation}

where the underbraced term is zero as $v(0) = 0 = v(1)$.
Hence the continuous weak form of \myref{eq:oned-deterministic} is to find $u
\in V$ such that:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:wk-oned-deterministic}
    a\int_0^1{u'(x)v'(x)\ dx} + b\int_0^1{u'(x)v(x)\ dx}
    + c\int_0^1{u(x)v(x)\ dx} = \int_0^1{f(x)v(x)\ dx}
\end{equation}

is satisfied $\forall w \in W$.

\section{Discrete Formulation}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\input{figures/oned-discretisation.tikz}
\caption{Example discretisation with N = 4}
\label{fig:one-d-discretisation}
\end{figure}

For a given parameter $N \in \mathbb{N}$ we define $N+1$ equally spaced nodes
$x_i$ $i \in \{0, \ldots, N\}$ in the interval $[0,1]$ where
$x_0 = 0, x_N = 1$. Then we can divide the domain into $N$ subintervals
$ I_i = [x_i, x_{i+1}]$, $i \in \{0,\ldots,N - 1\}$ of length $h = \frac{1}{N}$.
We can then define our discretisation to be:

\[
    D^h = \bigcup_{i=0}^{N - 1} I_i
\]

See Figure \ref{fig:one-d-discretisation} for an example discretisation
when $N=4$.  Upon such a discretisation we can define suitable finite
dimensional subspaces of our trial and test spaces $V^h \subset V$, $W^h
\subset W$.

\begin{align*}
    V^h &= \{v \in V: v \text{ is linear on } I_i,
          \ i \in \{0, \ldots, N - 1\},
          v \text{ is continuous on } [0, 1]\} \\
    W^h &= \{w \in W: w \text{ is linear on } I_i,
          \ i \in \{0, \ldots, N - 1\},
          w \text{ is continuous on } [0, 1]\}
\end{align*}

By choosing appropriate basis functions $\phi_i$ that span the space, we will
be able to approximate the solution:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:one-d-approx-soln}
    u^h(x) = \sum_{j = 0}^N{u_j\phi_j(x)}
\end{equation}

where $u_i$ will be the approximate value of the solution at the node $x_i$. In
a similar manner we will also be able to approximate $f(x)$:

\begin{equation}
    f(x) \approx \sum_{j = 0}^N f_j\phi_j(x)
\end{equation}

where $f_i = f(x_i)$. By writing the functions $u$ and $f$ in terms of their
values at the nodes $x_i$ then by taking a sufficiently large number of nodes
we can approximate them to within an acceptable margin of error.

An appropriate basis would be the so called `hat functions' which we can define
for each interior node as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:one-d-hat-basis}
    \phi_i(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{c c}
                    \frac{x - x_{i-1}}{x_i - x_{i - 1}}, & x \in [x_{i-1}, x_i] \\
                    \frac{x_{i+1} - x}{x_{i + 1} - x_i}, & x \in [x_i, x_{i + 1}] \\
                    0, & \text{otherwise}
                \end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

And in the special case of the boundary nodes $x_0$ and $x_N$ we only consider
the intervals which lie in our domain:

\begin{align}
    \phi_0(x) &= \left\{\begin{array}{c c}
                    \frac{x_1 - x}{x_1 - x_0}, & x \in [x_0, x_1] \\
                    0, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{array}\right.
    \\
    \phi_N(x) &= \left\{\begin{array}{c c}
                    \frac{x - x_{N - 1}}{x_N - x_{N-1}}, & x \in [x_{N-1}, x_N] \\
                    0, & \text{otherwise}
    \end{array}\right.
\end{align}

As the weak formulation \myref{eq:wk-oned-deterministic} must be satisfied for
all $v \in W$ then in particular it must be satisfied for the basis functions
$\phi_i(x)$. So by taking $v = \phi_i(x)$ for each $i \in \{1,\ldots,N-1\}$ and
substituting our approximations for $u$ and $f$ we obtain:

\begin{align*}
    a\int_0^1{\left(\sum_{j = 0}^N{u_j\phi_j(x)}\right)'\phi_i'(x)\, dx}
    &+b\int_0^1{\left(\sum_{j = 0}^N{u_j\phi_j(x)}\right)'\phi_i(x)\, dx} \\
    &+c\int_0^1{\left(\sum_{j = 0}^N{u_j\phi_j(x)}\right)\phi_i(x)\, dx} =
    \int_0^1{\left(\sum_{j = 0}^Nf_j\phi_j(x)\right)\phi_i(x)\, dx}
\end{align*}

By the linearity of the integrals and derivatives we can write this as:

\begin{align*}
    a\sum_{j = 0}^Nu_j\int_0^1\phi_i'(x)\phi_j'(x)\, dx
    &+b\sum_{j = 0}^Nu_j\int_0^1\phi_i(x)\phi_j'(x)\, dx \\
    &+c\sum_{j = 0}^Nu_j\int_0^1\phi_i(x)\phi_j(x)\, dx =
    \sum_{j = 0}^Nf_j\int_0^1\phi_i(x)\phi_j(x)\, dx
\end{align*}

for each $i \in \{1,\ldots,N-1\}$. Or equivalently:

\begin{align}\label{eq:oned-deterministic-discrete}
  \begin{split}
    \sum_{j = 0}^N\underbrace{\left(a\int_0^1\phi_i'(x)\phi_j'(x)\, dx
        + b\int_0^1\phi_i(x)\phi_j'(x)\, dx + c\int_0^1\phi_i(x)\phi_j(x)\, dx\right)}_{:= A_{i,j}}u_j  \\
    = \sum_{j = 0}^N\underbrace{\int_0^1{\phi_i(x)\phi_j(x)}\, dx}_{:= M_{i,j}}f_j
  \end{split}
\end{align}

This effectively reduces the weak formulation \myref{eq:wk-oned-deterministic}
to a linear system $Au^h = Mf$ where $A$ is known as the stiffness matrix and
$M$ is known as the mass matrix. Being a linear system it is relatively
straightforward to solve solve computationally for the unknown vector $u^h$ and
by taking a sufficiently fine discretisation we can achieve a good
approximation to the actual solution $u$.

\begin{equation}
    \sum_{j=0}^NA_{i,j}u_i = \sum_{j=0}^NM_{i,j}f_i,\ i \in \{1,\ldots,N-1\}
\end{equation}

However due to the Dirichlet condition we have in \myref{eq:oned-deterministic}
we already know the value of $u$ at the nodes $x_0$ and $x_N$ so in the cases
where $j = 0$ and $j = N$ the associated terms on the left hand side can be
removed from the system of equations. Furthermore as we know the value of our
solution $u$ at these nodes, we can move the associated terms over to the right
hand side:

\begin{equation}
    \sum_{j=1}^{N-1}A_{i,j}u_i =
        \sum_{j=1}^{N}M_{i,j}f_j - A_{i,0}u(0) - A_{i,N}u(1)
\end{equation}

In our particular problem we have a zero Dirichlet condition so the linear
system when written in matrix-vector form is given by:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:oned-deterministic-fem}
    A\v{u} = M\v{f}
\end{equation}

Solving this system for the vector $\v{u}$ will give us the approximate
solution to the equation \myref{eq:oned-deterministic}

\section{Constructing the Global Linear System}\label{sec:oned-deterministic-global-construct}

The final step in implementing the finite element method is to assemble the
global system of equations i.e.  determining the entries of $A_{i,j}$ and
$M_{i,j}$ which we currently have written in terms of a number of integrals
\myref{eq:oned-deterministic-discrete}. Due to the fact that our domain has
been subdivided into many subintervals we can consider the contribution from
each and combine them later into the global system.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\input{figures/oned-local-basis.tikz}
\caption{Example of the local basis functions $\psi_{k,1}$ and $\psi_{k,2}$
         in the interval $[x_k, x_{k + 1}]$}
\label{fig:oned-local-basis}
\end{figure}

Consider a subinterval $[x_k, x_{k+1}]$, as we can see in Figure
\ref{fig:oned-local-basis} due to the compact support of the global basis
functions $\phi_i$ each subinterval will have 2 local basis functions which we
will call $\psi_{k,1}$ and $\psi_{k,2}$ associated with it which we write as
follows:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:oned-deterministic-psi-1}
    \psi_{k,1}(x) = \frac{x_{k+1} - x}{x_{k+1} - x_k}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:oned-deterministic-psi-2}
    \psi_{k,2}(x) = \frac{x - x_k}{x_{k+1} - x_k}
\end{equation}

where the index $k$ corresponds with the index of the starting node of the
interval $x_k$.  This means we can write any function $v \in V^h$ locally in
the subinterval $[x_k, x_{k+1}]$ as:

\begin{align*}
    v(x) = v(x_k)\psi_{k,1}(x) + v(x_{k+1})\psi_{k,2}(x)
\end{align*}

which means locally we can rewrite \myref{eq:oned-deterministic-discrete} as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:oned-deterministic-local-discrete}
  \begin{split}
    \sum_{r = 1}^2\underbrace{\left(
          a\int_{x_k}^{x_{k+1}}\psi_{k,r}'(x)\psi_{k,s}'(x)\, dx
        + b\int_{x_k}^{x_{k+1}}\psi_{k,r}'(x)\psi_{k,s}(x)\, dx
        + c\int_{x_k}^{x_{k+1}}\psi_{k,r}(x)\psi_{k,s}(x)\, dx
    \right)}_{A^{(k)}_{r,s}}u_r  \\
    = \sum_{r= 1}^2\underbrace{
            \int_{x_k}^{x_{k+1}}{\psi_{k,r}(x)\psi_{k,s}(x)}\, dx}_{M^{(k)}_{r,s}}f_r
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

for $s = 1,2$. Which defines two $2 \times 2$ matrices which we will denote by
$A^{(k)}_{r,s}$ and $M^{(k)}_{r,s}$ and are called the local stiffness and
mass matrices, respectively. As we can see from the above, we will need the
derivatives of these local basis functions which are given by:

\begin{align}
  \begin{split}
    \psi_{k,1}'(x) &= \frac{-1}{x_{k+1} - x_{k}} \\
    \psi_{k,2}'(x) &= \frac{1}{x_{k+1} - x_{k}}
  \end{split}
\end{align}

\subsection{The Local Stiffness Matrix}\label{sec:oned-deterministic-local-stiffness}

We are now in a position where we can evaluate each of the entries of the local
stiffness matrix which involves calculating a number of integrals. For
the sake of brevity I will only explicitly compute a couple of examples here
and then present the results.

As we can see from \myref{eq:oned-deterministic-local-discrete} the entries of
the local stiffness matrix are given by the sum of three integrals. We will
consider each of them in turn, starting with the first one and taking $r = 1$,
$s = 1$ we have:

\begin{equation*}
       a\int_{x_k}^{x_{k+1}}\psi_{k,1}'(x)\psi_{k,1}'(x)\, dx =
         a\int_{x_k}^{x_{k+1}}\left(\frac{-1}{x_{k+1} - x_k}\right)^2\, dx
\end{equation*}

Noting that $x_{k+1} - x_k$ corresponds to the length of the subinterval
$[x_k, x_{k+1}]$ which we will denote $h_k$ then the integral becomes:

\begin{align*}
    \frac{a}{h_k^2}\int_{x_k}^{x_{k+1}}1\, dx &= \frac{a}{h_k^2}(x_{k+1} - x_k) \\
          &= \frac{a}{h_k}
\end{align*}

Similarly we can evaluate the second integral in the case where $r=1$, $s=2$:

\begin{align*}
    b\int_{x_k}^{x_{k+1}}\psi_{k,1}'(x)\psi_{k,2}(x)\, dx
      &=  b\int_{x_k}^{x_{k+1}}\left(\frac{-1}{x_{k+1} - x_k}\right)
                               \left(\frac{x - x_k}{x_{k+1} - x_k}\right)\, dx \\
      &= \frac{b}{h_k^2}\int_{x_k}^{x_{k+1}}x_k - x\, dx \\
      &= \frac{b}{h_k^2}\left[x_kx - \frac{x^2}{2}\right]_{x_k}^{x_{k+1}} \\
      &= \frac{b}{h_k^2}\left[ \frac{x_k^2 - x_{k+1}^2}{2} + x_{k+1}x_k - x_k^2 \right] \\
      &= \frac{b}{h_k^2}\left[ \frac{\overbrace{(x_k - x_{k+1})}^{-h_k}(x_k + x_{k+1})}{2}
              + x_k\underbrace{(x_{k+1} - x_k)}_{h_k}\right] \\
      &= \frac{b}{h_k}\left[ x_k - \frac{(x_{k+1} + x_k)}{2} \right] \\
      &= \frac{b}{h_k}\left[\frac{\overbrace{(x_k - x_{k+1})}^{-h_k}}{2}\right] \\
      &= -\frac{b}{2}
\end{align*}

Again taking $r=2$, $s=2$ we can evaluate the third integral in a similar manner:

\begin{align*}
    c\int_{x_k}^{x_{k+1}}\psi_{k,2}(x)\psi_{k,2}(x)\, dx
       &= \frac{c}{h_k^2}\int_{x_k}^{x_{k + 1}}(x - x_k)^2\, dx \\
       &= \frac{c}{h_k^2}\left[ \frac{(x - x_k)^3}{3} \right]_{x_k}^{x_{k+1}} \\
       &= \frac{c}{3h_k^2}\left[ (\underbrace{x_{k+1} - x_k}_{= h_k})^3
                            -(\underbrace{x_k - x_k}_{=0})^3\right] \\
       &= \frac{ch_k}{3}
\end{align*}

Proceeding as we have above and evaluating the remaining integrals gives us the
following form of the local stiffness matrix:


\begin{equation}\label{eq:oned-determinisitic-local-stiffness}
    A^{(k)} = \frac{a}{h_k}\left[\begin{array}{c c}
                1 & -1 \\ -1 & 1
              \end{array}\right]
              +\frac{b}{2}\left[\begin{array}{c c}
                -1 & 1\\ -1 & 1
              \end{array}\right]
              + \frac{ch_k}{6}\left[\begin{array}{c c}
                2 & 1 \\ 1 & 2
              \end{array}\right]
\end{equation}

where $a,b,c \in \mathbb{R}$ correspond to the coefficients in the original
equation \myref{eq:oned-deterministic} we are considering.

\subsection{The Local Mass Matrix}\label{sec:oned-deterministic-local-mass}

In an identical manner we can construct the entries for the local mass matrix,
as we can see in \myref{eq:oned-deterministic-local-discrete} it has the much
simpler form where each entry is given by a single integral. This integral
happens to be the same as the third integral in the local stiffness matrix not
including the value $c$. Therefore as we have already evaluated these integrals
we can write the local mass matrix directly as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:oned-deterministic-local-mass}
    M^{(k)} = \frac{h_k}{6}\left[\begin{array}{c c}
                2 & 1 \\ 1 & 2
              \end{array}\right]
\end{equation}

\subsection{Assembling the Global Stiffness Matrix}\label{sec:oned-deterministic-global-stiffness-assembly}

When assembling the Global stiffness matrix we need to take into account the
fact that the value at each node $x_k$ is dependent on the contributions from
the subintervals surrounding it. Looking again at Figure
\myref{fig:oned-local-basis} we can see intuitively a node $x_k$ receives a
contribution from the local basis functions $\psi_{k,1}(x)$ and
$\psi_{{k-1},2}(x)$. In fact, if we consider our definitions of the global
basis functions \myref{eq:one-d-hat-basis} we can write them in terms of local
basis functions as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:oned-deterministic-local-global-basis}
    \phi_k(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{c c}
                    \frac{x - x_{i-1}}{x_i - x_{i-1}} = \psi_{{k-1},2}(x)\, & x \in [x_{k-1}, x_k] \\
                    \frac{x_{i+1} - x}{x_{i+1} - x_i} = \psi_{k, 1}(x)\, & x \in [x_k, x_{k+1}] \\
                    0\, & \text{otherwise}
             \end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

So now if we consider the expression we have for the global stiffness matrix in
\myref{eq:oned-deterministic-discrete}:

\[
   A_{i,j} = a\int_0^1\phi_i'(x)\phi_j'(x)\, dx
             + b\int_0^1\phi_i'(x)\phi_j(x)\, dx
             + c\int_0^1\phi_i(x)\phi_j(x)\, dx
\]

and for the moment just consider the diagonal elements, corresponding to the
case where $i = k = j$ then using our new representation above for the global
basis functions then we have:

\begin{align*}
    A_{k,k} &= a\int_0^1\phi_k'(x)\phi_k'(x)\, dx + b\int_0^1\phi_k'(x)\phi_k(x)\, dx
               + c\int_0^1\phi_k(x)\phi_k(x)\, dx \\
            &= a\left(\int_{x_{k-1}}^{x_k}\psi_{{k-1},2}'(x)\psi_{{k-1},2}'(x)\, dx
                       + \int_{x_k}^{x_{k+1}}\psi_{k,1}'(x)\psi_{k,1}'(x)\, dx\right) \\
             &+ b \left(\int_{x_{k-1}}^{x_k}\psi_{k-1,2}'(x)\psi_{k-1,2}(x)\, dx
                       + \int_{x_k}^{x_{k+1}}\psi_{k,1}'(x)\psi_{k,1}(x)\, dx\right) \\
             &+ c \left(\int_{x_{k-1}}^{x_k}\psi_{k-1,2}(x)\psi_{k-1,2}(x)\, dx
                       + \int_{x_k}^{x_{k+1}}\psi_{k,1}(x)\psi_{k,1}(x)\, dx\right) \\
            &= \underbrace{\left(a\int_{x_{k-1}}^{x_k}\psi_{k-1,2}'(x)\psi_{k-1,2}'(x)\, dx
                       + b\int_{x_{k-1}}^{x_k}\psi_{k-1,2}'(x)\psi_{k-1,2}(x)\, dx
                       + c\int_{x_{k-1}}^{x_k}\psi_{k-1,2}(x)\psi_{k-1,2}(x)\, dx\right)}_{A^{(k-1)}_{2,2}} \\
            &+ \underbrace{\left(a\int_{x_k}^{x_{k+1}}\psi_{k,1}'(x)\psi_{k,1}'(x)\, dx
                       + b\int_{x_k}^{x_{k+1}}\psi_{k,1}'(x)\psi_{k,1}(x)\, dx
                       + c\int_{x_k}^{x_{k+1}}\psi_{k,1}(x)\psi_{k,1}(x)\, dx\right)}_{A^{(k)}_{1,1}}
\end{align*}

Hence the diagonal entries of the global stiffness matrix are given by $A_{k,k}
= A^{(k-1)}_{2,2} + A^{(k)}_{1,1}$ for $k \in \{1, \ldots, N - 1\}$. Following
a similar process for $A_{k,k+1}$ and $A_{k,k-1}$ which denote the
superdiagonal and subdiagonal entries respectively we find that:

\begin{align*}
    A_{k,k+1} &= A^{(k)}_{1,2} \\
    A_{k,k-1} &= A^{(k-1)}_{2,1}
\end{align*}

Finally note that for indices $i$,$j$ such that $|i - j| > 1$ the corresponding
global basis functions $\phi_i, \phi_j$ will not be simultaneously non zero in
any interval, so the corresponding entries in the global stiffness matrix will
be zero. So the global stiffness matrix will take the following form:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:oned-deterministic-global-stiffness}
    A = \left[\begin{array}{c c c c c}
         \left(A^{(0)}_{2,2} + A^{(1)}_{1,1}\right) & A^{(1)}_{1,2} & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
         A^{(1)}_{2,1} & \left(A^{(1)}_{2,2} + A^{(2)}_{1,1}\right) & A^{(2)}_{1,2} & \cdots & 0 \\

\subsection{Assembling the Global Mass Matrix}\label{sec:oned-deterministic-global-mass-assembly}

We can follow a very similar process to assembling the global mass matrix as we
did above, first we note that we can rewrite the global basis functions as we
did in \myref{eq:oned-deterministic-local-global-basis} and then consider the
expression we have for the global mass matrix in
\myref{eq:oned-deterministic-discrete}:

\[
    M_{i,j} = \int_0^1\phi_i(x)\phi_j(x)\, dx
\]

Let's first consider the super diagonal elements of the mass matrix:

\begin{align*}
    M_{k,k+1} &= \int_0^1\phi_k(x)\phi_{k+1}\, dx \\
              &= \underbrace{\int_{x_{k-1}}^{x_k}\psi_{k-1,2}(x) \cdot 0\, dx}_{ = 0}
               + \underbrace{\int_{x_k}^{x_{k+1}}\psi_{k,1}(x)\psi_{k,2}(x)\, dx}_{= M^{(k)}_{1,2}}
               + \underbrace{\int_{x_{k+1}}^{x_{k+2}}0 \cdot \psi_{k+1,1}(x)\, dx}_{= 0} \\
              &= M^{(k)}_{1,2}
\end{align*}

Similarly we find:

\begin{align*}
    M_{k,k} &= M^{(k-1)}_{2,2} + M^{(k)}_{1,1} \\
    M_{k,k-1} &= M^{(k-1)}_{2,1}
\end{align*}

Also as before for any indices $i,j$ such that $|i - j| > 1$ the corresponding
global basis functions $\phi_i$,$\phi_j$ will not be simultaneously non zero in
any interval so the corresponding entries in the global mass matrix will be
zero. Hence the global mass matrix takes the following form:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:oned-deterministic-global-mass}
    M = \left[\begin{array}{c c c c c c}
            M^{(0)}_{2,1} & \left(M^{(0)}_{2,2} + M^{(1)}_{1,1}\right) & M^{(1)}_{1,2} & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
            0 & M^(1)_{2,1} & \left(M^(1)_{2,2} + M^(2)_{1,1}\right) & M^{(2)}_{1,2} & \cdots & 0 \\
            \vdots & & \ddots & & & \vdots \\
            0 & \cdots & M^{(N-2)}_{2,1} & \left(M^{(N-2)}_{2,2} + M^{(N-1)}_{1,1}\right) & M^{(N-1)}_{1,2} & 0  \\
            0 &\cdots & 0 & M^{(N-1)}_{2,1} & \left(M^{(N-1)}_{2,2} + M^{(N)}_{1,1}\right) & M^{(N)}_{1,2}
        \end{array}\right]
\end{equation}


\section{Example Problems and Results}

Since obtaining numerical approximations that are reasonably accurate requires
rather large linear systems of equations, it is necessary to use a computer to
construct and solve these linear systems for us.  I have chosen to make use of
the Python programming language and used the Numpy linear algebra library
\cite{numpy-array} in order construct and solve the resulting linear system
\myref{eq:oned-deterministic-fem} with Matplotlib \cite{matplotlib} used to
visualise the results.

It is important to verify that any code we write is functioning as we expect it
to, so for this set of examples we will choose a particular solution to the
problem, so that we can evaluate the error and rate of convergence. Choosing
$u(x) = \sin{(\pi x)}$ as our solution and various values for our parameters
$a,b,c$ we can easily construct the corresponding right hand side of the
equation.

Considering the following cases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $a = 1, b = 0, c = 0$ and
          $f(x) = \pi^2\sin{(\pi x)}$
    \item $a = 1, b = 0, c = 1$ and
          $f(x) = \pi^2\sin{(\pi x)} + \sin{(\pi x)}$
    \item $a = 1, b = 0, c = 10$ and
          $f(x) = \pi^2\sin{(\pi x)} + 10\sin{(\pi x)}$
    \item $a = 1, b = 2, c = 0$ and
          $f(x) = \pi^2\sin{(\pi x)} + 2\pi\cos{(\pi x)}$
\end{itemize}

and recording the $L^2$ norm of the error at each value of $N$ we obtain the
plot seen in Figure \ref{fig:oned-deterministic-error}. In Figure
\ref{fig:oned-deterministic-exact-v-approx} we see the exact solution plotted
against one of our approximations in the case where $a = 1, b = 0, c = 0$.
