\chapter{An Introductory Example}

Before we start with any of the polynomial choas it would be good to consider a
few example problems partly to help us ensure our implementation of the finite
elemenet method is working correctly and for comparison.

We will consider Laplace's equation (\ref{eq:general_laplace}) with $a = 1, \v{b}
= \v{0}, c = 0$ in the square domain $\Omega = [0, 1] \times [0, 1]$ and we'll
impose the Dirichlet condition that $u = 0$ on $\partial\Omega$

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=5]
        \draw (0,0) -- (1,0);
        \draw (1,0) -- (1,1);
        \draw (1,1) -- (0,1);
        \draw (0,1) -- (0,0);

        \node[below] at (0,0){$(0,0)$};
        \node[below] at (1,0){$(1,0)$};
        \node[left] at (0,1){$(0,1)$};
        \node[right] at (1,1){$(1,1)$};
        \node at (0.5, 0.5){$\Omega$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{align*}
    \Delta u &= f\, \text{ in $\Omega$} \\
           u &= 0\, \text{ on $\partial\Omega$}
\end{align*}
